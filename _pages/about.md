💻 I'm a final year master's student in bioinformatics at the University of Porto.

🧬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities to enhance personal diagnosis.

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing in the context of computational biology.
