🧬 I have recently completed my Master's in Bioinformatics at the University of Porto, and I am now seeking a PhD position.

🩻 My research interests focus on working with multi-modalities, whether merging vision and text or integrating multi-omics data in the biology field. My main motivation is to generate valuable insights that can improve healthcare systems and personalized diagnosis.

📚 My Master's thesis focused on generating automatic reports from histopathological images by integrating Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am now working on a publication to present the main results of this work.

👨🏻‍💻 Since completing my bachelor's degree, I've been working as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer for various companies across multiple sectors.

# A little bit more about me
With a background in Physics, I've been working as a Data Scientist since 2018. My experience spans across multiple domains, including retail, supply chain, and healthcare, where I have applied my skills in data analysis and machine learning to drive innovation and improve decision-making.

As a consultant and currently a self-employed professional, I've had the opportunity to work on a range of projects, utilizing a wide array of techniques and skills. My hands-on experience covers various aspects of Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Data Engineering, and deployment of solutions.

Have recently comcluded a Master's degree in Bioinformatics, I am enthusiastic about exploring the intersection of data science and healthcare. My academic journey has enriched my experience in areas such as deep learning and computer vision, and enhanced my comprehension of data science's applications in real-world scenarios.
